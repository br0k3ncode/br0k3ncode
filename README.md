Thanks for visiting my br0k3ncode GitHub profile.  I thought this was a funny username because when I started that's how all of my attempts at scripting and coding felt.

- I'm currently working on bash scripts for a work project.
- I'm currently learning networking engineering, bash, python, ansible, Red Hat, and wanting to get into learning about docker container deployment.
- I'm looking to collaborate on any of the topics listed in my learning topics above to imporve my skills.
- Ask me about electronics in general as I have 20+ years experience working on complex electronics and networking.  Also, ask me about bash as I have a moderate understanding.
- Fun fact: I was a RADAR, navigation aid, and communications electronics technician and system admin for 22 years before I moved solely into IT.
